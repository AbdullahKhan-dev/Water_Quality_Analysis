# Water Quality Analysis and Visualization

## Description

This Python project showcases the process of reading, stacking, and visualizing water quality data using data manipulation libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. It provides a practical demonstration of how to work with compressed data files, transform data, and create informative visualizations.

### Key Features

- **Data Extraction:** The project begins by extracting data from a zip file containing water quality information.
- **Data Stacking:** It utilizes the neonUtilities package to stack data, making it more accessible and structured for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** The primary focus is on visualizing water quality trends over time. The code employs seaborn to create a line plot, displaying the alkalinity of water in Wyoming over the year 2021.
